    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  Simon Bromberg built the CashTracker app as
                  a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by
                  Simon Bromberg at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is.
                </p> <p>
                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                  used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p>
                  The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                  as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
                  CashTracker unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                  No personal data or information is collected by the app nor is any such data or information exported by the app to any third parties.
                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  All data used by the app is stored locally on a user's device (and potentially stored in iCloud and subject to the policies of that service).
                  It is advised that users follow standard security measures for their personal devices to keep their information secure.
                  By using the application you acknowledge that no additional security is provided by the application and
                  it is your responsibility to maintain the security of your information as you see fit.
                </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me.
                  Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                  Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                  no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
                  privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
                  services.
                </p> <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p> <!----> <div><p>
                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children. I
                    encourage all children to never submit any personally
                    identifiable information through
                    the Application and/or Services.
                    I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor
                    their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing
                    their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child
                    has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services,
                    please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing
                    of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent
                    or guardian to do so on your behalf).
                  </p></div> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Privacy Policy from
                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I will
                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                  this page.
                </p> <p>This policy is effective as of 2021-12-25</p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>
